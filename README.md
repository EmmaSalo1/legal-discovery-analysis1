## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd legal-discovery-analysis
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
docker-compose up --build
```

### Render Deployment Notes
- Set `TESSERACT_PATH` to `/usr/bin/tesseract` on Render or other Linux hosts.
- **Install required system packages on Debian-based hosts:**
  - `libgl1` (for OpenCV)
  - `ffmpeg` (for video/audio processing)
  - `tesseract-ocr` (for OCR)
  - Example:
    ```bash
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgl1 ffmpeg tesseract-ocr
    ```
    Include these in your custom Docker build or install them on the host before running the containers.
- Run the Celery worker alongside the API:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up worker
  ```

#### Option 2: Deploy to a remote host

To make the application accessible from any network, you can run it on a small
cloud server or a Platform-as-a-Service provider that supports Docker. Clone the
repository on the server, configure the environment variables in `.env`, and run
`docker-compose up --build -d`. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
for a step-by-step deployment walkthrough.
